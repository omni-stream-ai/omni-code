# Omni-code Todo Management

## Overview
Use this skill to keep the `omni-code` GitHub Project organized and consistent. Backlog stays draft-only; Todo and later use real GitHub issues.

## Project Rules
- Project: `https://github.com/orgs/omni-stream-ai/projects/2`
- Keep card text in English.
- One task per card.
- Use `Backlog` for draft items only.
- Create a GitHub Issue only when the item moves to `Todo`.
- Keep active work limited; `In Progress` should usually have one owner.

## Status Flow
- `Backlog`: draft only, not yet an issue.
- `Todo`: ready to become an issue and be worked on.
- `In Progress`: actively being worked on.
- `Review`: waiting for review or verification.
- `Blocked`: waiting on a dependency.
- `Done`: complete and verified.

## Labels
Use these base labels:
- `bug`
- `feature`
- `refactor`
- `docs`
- `test`
- `infra`

## Priority Heuristics
- `High`: core session, agent, or model behavior.
- `Medium`: session settings, model controls, or tool output UX.
- `Low`: polish, navigation, or convenience work.

## Common Workflow
1. Read current project state with `gh project item-list 2 --owner omni-stream-ai --format json`.
2. Add a backlog draft with `gh project item-create 2 --owner omni-stream-ai --title ... --body ...`.
3. When the item is ready, create the GitHub Issue in `omni-stream-ai/omni-code`, add it to the project, and move `Status` to `Todo`.
4. Use `gh project item-edit` to change title, body, status, and priority.
5. Resolve current field and option IDs with `gh project field-list 2 --owner omni-stream-ai --format json` before editing if needed.

## Notes
- Draft content IDs start with `DI_`.
- Project item IDs start with `PVTI_`.
- See `references/project-facts.md` for current field and option IDs.
- Current recurring themes:
  - continuous voice conversations
  - switching agents mid-session
  - shared model configuration
  - per-session settings
  - clickable code file content
  - tool output presentation
  - additional system prompts
